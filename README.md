In this challenge I have used Leaflet.js to create map and plotted earth quake data using USGS GeoJSON Feed (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
<br>
<br>
On the map plotted you can observe the following:
<br>
- View map in options : Street map, Topographic map and as a greyscale map
- Observe Earthquake markers with their radius being propotional to the magnitude of the earthquake and color being set according to the depth of earth at that point
- A legend stating the depth and corresponding color
- When clicked on a marker a pop up can be observed that describes the place, time and magnitude of the earthquake
